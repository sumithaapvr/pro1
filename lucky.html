<h1><CENTER>LUCKY LEARNERS</CENTER></h1>
<p>Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants.</p>
<h3>IMPORTANCE OF LEARNING</h3>
<p> Continuous learning is important because it helps people to feel happier and more fulfilled in their lives and careers, and to maintain stronger cognitive functioning when they get older.<br></br>

Learning by doing encourages active involvement with the available medium of information and requires you to work harder to memorize it. However, it's a productive method because it helps you embed knowledge into your memory.<br></br>
Studies have found that learning throughout our lives can improve self-esteem and increase life-satisfaction, optimism and belief in our own abilities. It can even help those with mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and some GP practices actually prescribe education as part of the treatment package.</p>
